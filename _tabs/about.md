I am a Cybersecurity Engineer, with six years of experience in the industry. 

The majority of my work has been in the areas of malware analysis, vulnerability research, and program analysis. I am working to get into the habit of writing up my work, so this will ideally grow over time. Until then, thank you for checking this out, and please reach out with any ideas, suggestions, or questions.
